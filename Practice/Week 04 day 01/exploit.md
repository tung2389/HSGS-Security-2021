1. commmand.c
- We just need to input something like: **test; ls -la** and the program will list all files and directories in the current directory.

2. buffoverflow.c
- Please compile the program with the following command to turn off buffer overflow protection: 
```
gcc -fno-stack-protector -o buffoverflow buffoverflow.c
```
- Run the program, enter the following input and watch strange things happens :) 
**adfasfasddafdshfasfkdsfhjkasjfhasdkfhasdlfkasdhfasfhjsdafashdkf**

- Actually, the content of the input doesnn't matter. Just make sure you put in a **long enough**, BUT **not too long**, input. Use ```objdump -D buffoverflow``` to see why this input causes a buffer overflow. 

3. integeroverflow2.c
- a is a unsigned 8-bit int and b is a signed 8-bit int. Since these types are smaller than int, they both get converted to signed int in the expression. Regarding signed-8 bit int, b = 200 = -56. Therefore, when converting to signed int, a becomes 100 and b becomes -56. Therefore, a > b and "yes" is printed.

4. integeroverflow.c

- a is a signed 8-bit int, therefore the maximum number it can represented is 127. When we increase a bigger than 127, a becomes negative. Since negative numbers are represented using 2's complement, we can see that a becomes -128, -127, -126, ... and so on.

- b is an unsigned 8-bit int. Therefore, when we assign -1 to b, b becomes 255. You can read more about this here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2711522/what-happens-if-i-assign-a-negative-value-to-an-unsigned-variable

5. formatstringerror.c

- If you input something like "%d.%d.%d.%d" or "%x.%x.%x.%x", you can read data from stack, things that you cannot do normally.
